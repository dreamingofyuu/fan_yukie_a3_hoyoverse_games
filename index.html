      <h2>Genshin Impact</h2>
      <img src="Genshin_Impact.webp" alt="Genshin Impact">
      <p>Platform Played on: PC/Mobile <br>
      Number of Months played: 6 <br>
      Money spent: $0 <br>
      Favourite Character: Xiao <br>
      Favourite Event: Lantern Rite <br>
      Personal Rating: 9.5/10 <br>
      Reason: I've been playing Genshin since the release and I've had my fair share of ups and downs. There have been times in which I've stopped playing for months on end. I was first attracted to this game by its beautiful graphics despite it being free to download and play. The storylines, animations, character development, and gameyplay is what allows me to give Genshin such a high rating. This game was my comfort game throughout the years in which COVID had locked me in my room. However much I love the game, I took 0.5 off my rating due to its tedious committment system. As a free-to-play player, I cannot afford to spend copious amounts of money to abtain the characters I want. Thus I need to grind out the game and work for the in-game currency. With academics taking much of my time, I simply could not commit to the game anymore. Nonetheless, I will occasionally get back on the game just to see my favourite characters and participate in some limited time events when I get the chance.</p>

      Favourite Chartacter: Dan Heng <br>
      Favourite Event: ??? <br>
      Personal Rating: 8/10 <br>
      Reason: Coming from the same company of Genshin Impact, I also played Honkai since the beginning of its era. However, I found this game less appealing to Genshin and quickly dropped it. I occasionally got on to play when I could, but the gameplay just felt lacking compared to Genshin. Perhaps it was due to how much content others had already completed compare to me, but I felt like I would be unable to catch up to the rapidly progressing storyline. The design and gameplay was what brought it to such a high rating, but for me, I just couldn't keep up with the game.</p>

      <h2>Love and Deepspace</h2>
      <img src="1500x500.webp" alt="Love and Deepspace">
      <p>Platform Played on: Mobile <br>
      Number of Months played: 11 <br>
      Money spent: $30 <br>
      Favourite Character: Sylus <br>
      Favourite Event: When Drakeshadows Fall <br>
      Rating: 9.9/10
      Reason: Love and Deepspace is the game I currently play everyday. I first saw their ad on Instagram and immediately wanted to play. Their game is an Otome game, a dating simulator based on a female protagonist, and their concept was really unique to me. Albeit their plot gets a little confusing, their graphics are stunning, the events are easy to follow, and the characters are very attractive. Not just one or two that are clearly biased, but the company creates their characters to be equally attractive with their fair share of limited event cards. Different from most visual novels, this game incoporates battle sequences to allow it to truly feel like a game rather than just a boring grind for character affection.</p>

    <section id="Valorant" class="games">
      <h2>Valorant</h2>
      <img src="valorant-logo-FAB2CA0E55-seeklogo.com.png" alt="Valorant">
      <p>Platform Played on: PC <br>
      Number of Months played: 8 <br>
      Money spent: $80 <br>
      Most Played Character: Killjoy <br>
      Most Played Gamemode: Competitive <br>
      Rating: 8.5/10 <br>
      Reason: Valorant may be one of two games that I have a love-hate relationship with. Sometimes, my matches can go really well and I do amazing, other days I can go 0/10/2 (K/D/A). However, like many multiplayer games, I mainly play with my friens. They make those 10 loss streaks bareable and fun. Gameplay wise, Valorant is fun and unique with all its agents and their many abilities. With map glitches or lineups, a player has unlimited possibilities to win their match. There are many gamemodes that the game has to offer; if you get tired of normal gun shooting, you can switch to a rotating-weapons mode. Graphics wise, it's not bad, but there can be some improvements. Overall, Valorant isn't half bad when I'm winning with friends.</p>

      <h2>League of Legends</h2>
      <img src="d1b11d5e4dbae547ac0d651476cec488.jpg" alt="League of Legends">
      <p>Platform Played on: PC <br>
      Number of Months played: 12 <br>
      Money spent: $0 <br>
      Most Played Character: Ahri <br>
      Most Played Gamemode: Summoner's Rift: Normal <br>
      Rating: 7/10 <br>
      Reason: League is not any better than Valorant, but I have significantly more play time on it due to my laptop's inability to run Valorant. Filled with toxic players, I often find myself being annoyed at their players and have to take breaks from playing the game. That's why I try to play with my friends rather than strangers. Graphics wise, the in-game graphics are as good as they get with a MOBA game, but their splash art is really nice. Each character comes with their own splash art that ties into their own lore. Some of them are interconnected in some way while others include interesting details. The characters also have cosmetics called "Skins". These skins allow players to look cool in-game (the rift) and offer lots of unique effects. Within skinlines, there are also lores of their own, thus making it a game perfect for lore fanatics like me. The game comes with many gamemodes like Norms (normal), Ranked, Flex (Ranked with 5 players of the same party), ARAM (All Mid All Random), and TFT (Teamfight Tactics).</p>

      <h2>Minecraft</h2>
      <img src="Minecraft_Bedrock_icon.png" alt="Minecraft">
      <p>Platform Played on: PC <br>
      Number of Months played: 5 <br>
      Money spent: $0 <br>
      Most Played Character: N/A <br>
      Most Played Gamemode: Freeplay <br>
      Rating: 10/10 <br>
      Reason: Minecraft, my other slightly comfort game. I don't really play this one on my own either. I love building bases with friends and playing mini games (even though I'm really bad at them). However, I haven't played much since I get pretty motion sick from the game and after a while, the game gets a bit boring. The game is still ever-changing with each new update, so I look forward to those.</p>

      <img src="c66e591693fd6e7b26fc5a60efb68817.png" alt="The Sims 4">
      <p>Platform Played on: PC <br>
      Number of Months played: 10 <br>
      Money spent: $??? <br>
      Most Played Character: N/A <br>
      Most Played Gamemode: N/A <br>
      Rating: 8.5/10 <br>
      Reason: I only play The Sims when I have time to. This includes time that I don't have academic work or when none of my friends are online to play. I don't remember how much I've spent on expansion packs and dlcs for this game, but it's been quite a few. I first got this game for my love of interior design. When I got this game, I was so sure that I was going to go to Ryerson for Interior Design, but I ended up going elsewhere. Nonetheless, it's always fun to customize my OCs from books I write into The Sims. I am able to build and better visualize how my imaginary world and characters would look.</p>
